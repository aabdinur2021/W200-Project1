    "\n",
    "- All calculations need to be done in the functions (that includes any formatting)\n",
    "- Name your functions exactly as written in the problem statement\n",
    "- Please have your functions return the answer rather than printing it inside the function\n",
    "- Do not make a separate input() statement.  The functions will be passed the input as shown in the examples\n",
    "- The examples given are samples of how we will test/grade your code. Please ensure your functions output the same information\n",
    "- Answer format is graded - please match the examples\n",
    "- Other than for Part 5, user / function inputs do not need to be validated or checked. (For example, if the problem states input an integer we will check it by inputting an integer)\n",
    "- Docstrings and comments in your code are strongly suggested but won't be graded\n",
    "- This homework is mostly auto-graded.  The blank code blocks are the auto-grading scripts - please do not delete these!\n",
    "- Your code needs to be written in the ```#Your Code Here``` blocks or it wont be graded correctly.\n",
    "- There are also test cells for you to test your functions against the examples and the autograder. Please try to format your output so that the autograder will read it correctly. That being said, if you are confident your answer is correct and the auotograder still doesn't like it, you don't need to spend time trying to figure it out. Every answer that the autograder marks incorrect, we will manually check for completeness!"
